Basic concepts of initialization, manipulation, and encaptulation will be covered as well as some not so easy topics like inheritance. These concepts will be built up through a non-mathematical example and will then be extended to a mathematical example using common libraries like Numpy, SciPy, and matplotlib. No prior knowledge of OOP is required!\n",
