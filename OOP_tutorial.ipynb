    "Those of you who have programmed in a machine language (C, Fortran, etc.) will know the joy of working with pointers. You may have been told that pointers do not exist in Python but unfortunately you have been told wrong. Python pointers are burried in the inner workings of Python's framework so they are invisible to the user. However, when you get deep into OOP in Python not understanding how this memory concept works, pointers can come back to haunt you.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this example, I will should you a simple way that pointers exist in OOP in Python. Also, I will introduce the concept of importing your own classes in Python. There is a file called \"oop.py\" in this GitHub repo which contains an extremely simple class that we will import to use in this example. "
